# Gesture Recognition and Communication System

## Project Overview
This project is a real-time gesture recognition and communication system that uses computer vision and machine learning to interpret hand gestures. The system can recognize various hand gestures and convert them into text and audio output, making it particularly useful for communication and accessibility purposes.

## Core Features
1. **Real-time Gesture Recognition**
   - Uses MediaPipe for hand tracking and gesture detection
   - Supports multiple gesture types including numbers, letters, and common gestures
   - Real-time video processing with webcam input

2. **Gesture Types Supported**
   - Numbers (1-5)
   - Basic gestures (Hello, Yes, No, OK, Peace, Rock, etc.)
   - Letters (A, B)
   - Custom gestures

3. **Audio Feedback**
   - Text-to-speech conversion of recognized gestures
   - Configurable audio output settings
   - Real-time audio feedback

4. **Web Interface**
   - Flask-based web application
   - Real-time video feed display
   - Interactive controls for audio and camera settings
   - Responsive design

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.x
- **Web Framework**: Flask 2.0.1
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV 4.5.3.56
- **Hand Tracking**: MediaPipe 0.8.9.1
- **Text-to-Speech**: gTTS 2.2.3
- **Dependencies**: See requirements.txt

## System Architecture
1. **Gesture Recognition Module**
   - Hand landmark detection
   - Gesture classification
   - Confidence scoring
   - Gesture history tracking

2. **Web Application**
   - Video stream processing
   - Real-time gesture detection
   - Audio generation and playback
   - User interface management

3. **Audio Processing**
   - Text-to-speech conversion
   - Audio file management
   - Real-time audio feedback

## Key Components
1. **app.py**
   - Main application entry point
   - Web server configuration
   - Route handlers
   - Video processing pipeline

2. **gesture_recognition.py**
   - Core gesture recognition logic
   - Hand tracking implementation
   - Gesture classification algorithms
   - Confidence scoring system

## Usage
1. **Setup**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Accessing the Application**
   - Open web browser
   - Navigate to localhost:5000
   - Allow camera access
   - Start using gestures

## Performance Considerations
- Optimized camera settings for real-time processing
- Gesture smoothing to reduce false positives
- Configurable confidence thresholds
- Efficient video frame processing

## Future Enhancements
1. **Potential Improvements**
   - Support for more gesture types
   - Enhanced accuracy through machine learning
   - Multi-language support
   - Custom gesture training
   - Mobile application support

2. **Accessibility Features**
   - Customizable gesture mappings
   - Adjustable sensitivity settings
   - Multiple output formats
   - Integration with other accessibility tools

## Security and Privacy
- Local processing of video data
- No external data transmission
- Secure web interface
- Camera access controls
